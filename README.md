OpenNETCF Shared Libraries

This is a collection of some of my more active libraries. As I make changes to others, I'll migrate them here.  If you know me, you know I've got lots of code.  Lots and lots and lots of code.

Sure, separating them may have made sense, but many have interdependencies and shared code so this is the easiest way for me to manage it.

In this collection are things for pure desktop Windows as well as things for Xamaring Forms and even Compact Framework libraries.

There's everything from controls to a solid inversion of control/dependency injection framework (with some MVVM added for the Xamarin side).

If you want to help out, pull requests are welcome, but please follow formatting and naming standards already in use by the code.
